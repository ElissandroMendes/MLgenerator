# Machine Learning Code Generator

A web-app to generate code for different machine learning task.

It is developed in my free time while learning and main motivation is to help machine learning beginers with starter code. 

Try out MLGenerator : [https://ml-generator.herokuapp.com](https://ml-generator.herokuapp.com)

MLGenerator is simple web based machine learning starter code generator, build using [streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io). You can build custom starter code for different machine learning algorithms/tasks such as Regression, Classification, Clustering and Anomaly(Outlier) detection. MLGenerator uses different widely used Python libraries for different task such as Scikit-Learn, PyOD etc.
