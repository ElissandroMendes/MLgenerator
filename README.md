# Machine Learning Code Generator

A web-app to generate code for different machine learning task.

It is developed in my free time while learning and main motivation is to help machine learning beginers with starter code. 

## Major Machine Learning Code

1. Regression
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Exponential Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Logarithmic Regression

2. Classification
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine
- Naive Bayes

3. Clustering
- K-means
- DBSCAN
- Hierarchical

4. Anomaly Detection
- LOF
- iForest

5. Dimensionality Reduction
- PCA
- t-SNE
